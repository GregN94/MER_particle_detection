Application contained in this repository is used to detect sand particles on Microscopic Images taken by Opportunity rever during Mars Exploration Rover mission.

Application is based on PADM algorithm described in dr J. Kozakiewicz article *“Image analysis algorithm for detection and measurement of martian sand grains"*.

Application was written in Matlab language and it contains multiple files, where **bin_ui.m** is the main file which will startup full GUI application.
